During my tenure at Cofense, I've been an active contributor on
application modernization efforts, new project initiatives, and
contributions to the company's internal component library.

My responsibilities have included representing the UI team in project
development, acting as a team lead across various products, and planning
initiatives to improve the UI codebase. I'm currently serving as the 
UI Engineering Manager in charge of all UI projects across the 
organization.
