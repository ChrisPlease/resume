Kenzan is a software development consulting agency. During my tenure
at Kenzan, I served as an embedded engineer on various client teams. This
experience gave me the opportunity to work on various cutting edge 
technologies. At the time, Kenzan's focus was microservice architecture 
patterns, which exposed me to edge tier backend development via various
NodeJS services.
