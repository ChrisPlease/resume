Kenzan is a software development consulting agency. I served as
an embedded engineer on various client teams. My experience at Kenzan
gave me the opportunity to learn a breadth of technology stacks, as
each client had different project requirements. 

I also spent time working on Kenzan internal project initiatives, which
gave me the opportunity to get my hands on emerging technologies as the
company assessed these technologies for client implementation.

Because of Kenzan's focus on microservice architecture, my work included
work on various edge tier services built in node.

Responsibilities include:
* Worked on various applications including data-driven, feature-rich internal projects to large scale client web applications driven through micro-service architectures
* Utilized front-end technologies including:
  * Angular 1.x and React
  * Javascript ES5 and ES6
  * CSS/SASS/LESS
  * HTML5
  * npm and yarn
  * Webpack
* Full Stack experience:
  * Node.js
  * Express
  * MongoDB
  * Loopback
  * AWS
