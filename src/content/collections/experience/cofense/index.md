I've served as Senior Front End Engineer, and later (currently) as 
a technical UI Engineering Manager. In these roles, I've had the 
opportunity to fully immerse myself in the Vue framework. 

I've had the opportunity to mentor junior developers. I run the 
company's UI Community of Practice (weekly meeting for the UI team 
to share news/insights), provide thorough code reviews, and frequently 
pair program with junior engineers.

As a Senior Front End Engineer and technical manager, I've served as 
team lead on several of the company's UI initiatives. These 
initiatives include:

* Plan/Implement a major release of the internal component library 
  * converting components to TSX
  * dark/light mode support
  * `a11y` audit and improvement
  * documentation rewrite in Storybook/MDX
* Rebuild flagship product from legacy Rails app to Vue SPA
* Several greenfield initiatives/product offerings
