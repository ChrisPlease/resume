My roles at Cofense include both Senior Front End Engineer, and 
UI Engineering Manager. 

During my time at Cofense, I've led the company's UI Community
of Practice, spearheaded the UI team's migration to TypeScript,
and helped guide the team through a major version upgrade of
the company's internal component library (TSX migration, dark mode
support, responsive design).

Additionally, I've been the lead UI engineer on several of
the company's initiatives, including the ground up
redesign/rewrite of the flagship product into a modern framework, 
and migrating legacy products to TypeScript.
