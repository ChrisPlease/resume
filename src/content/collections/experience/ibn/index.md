Ideas By Nature was a small crypto marketing agency specializing
in decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain.

My role as UI lead at IBN included functioning as product team lead 
on multiple client applications. I was responsible for developing
the company's versatile styleguides that could be easily adapted
to any clients needs. I also helped established the company's best
practices around code reusability, unit testing, and UI build 
pipelines.
