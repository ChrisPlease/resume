Webolutions is a small marketing agency located in the Denver Metro Area.

My responsibilities as web developer included desiging and implementing
custom WordPress themes and plugins for a diverse set of clients. 
I was heavily involved through the entire evolution of a new 
WordPress website, from meeting with the client to discover their 
needs, to final delivery of the product.
