Webolutions is a small marketing agency located in the Denver Metro Area.

In my role as engineer at Webolutions, my responsibilities included 
desiging and implementing custom WordPress themes and plugins for 
a diverse set of clients. I was heavily involved through the entire
evolution of a new WordPress website, from meeting with the client to
discover their needs, to final delivery of the product.
