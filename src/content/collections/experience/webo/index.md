Webolutions is a small marketing agency located in the Denver Metro Area. I 
was responsible for designing and implementing custom WordPress themes, 
plugins, and extensions for various client websites. Each site began with
an internal, barebones WordPress theme. My role included initial design
with the client, then build the theme and any necessary plugins to deliver
the final product. I was involved with the full development stack.
