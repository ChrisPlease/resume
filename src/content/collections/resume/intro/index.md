<!-- I'm a Front End Engineer with over 10 years in the industry. Most 
recently, I've been working as a Senior Front End Engineer, and 
later Engineering Manager for Cofense. 

While I started my career in WordPress plugin and theme 
development, the bulk of my career has been focused on writing 
elegant, highly accessible front end applications with maximum 
component reusability in mind. 

I began my front end career with AngularJS, but quickly moved into
React develoment. The bulk of my experience has been writing React
code for companies of various sizes and consumer demographics. 
During that time, I worked with `a11y` specialists to develop the 
fundamentals for writing clean, semantic, and accessible code.
