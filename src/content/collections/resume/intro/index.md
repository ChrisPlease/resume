Dedicated and passionate front end engineer with over 10 years 
experience in the industry. Experience in working with teams
of all sizes. Specializing in writing semantic HTML, clean CSS, 
and highly reusable components in modern front end applications.
I have a keen eye for semantic HTML, 
<span class="screen-only">`a11y`</span><span class="print-only">
accessibility</span>, responsive design, and unit testing.

In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my wife and dog. I'm 
passionate about IoT projects around the house, and learning new 
and exciting frameworks and build tools (currently on SvelteKit).
